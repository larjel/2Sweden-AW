## Welcome
Imagine that Sweden hosts the Winter Olympics 2024 (which they don't, but anyway).

This is a web page for finding possible travel options from anywhere in the world to three different locations in Sweden where the Olympics would be held.

It is a two part React web application with a client (frontend) part and a server part.

It uses the Rome2Rio Rest API to fetch trip data and OpenStreetMap to display the trip on a map.
